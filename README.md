This project is the final project in the Learn HTML & CSS course on Scrimba.

In this final project, I will be covering all of the topics discussed under Learn HTML & CSS course on Scrimba.

Reflections and Realizations

This project took me quite a while. Firstly, I didn't know how to show the whole image under the hero-section div when I maximize my browser. Secondly, I believe the images I used in the activities-section div should be of the same sizes to be able to visually align them. The texts under them should have almost similar character count, too, perhaps. Anyway, I still have a lot to learn after this course: media queries, image fitting processes, alignments and spacings.
